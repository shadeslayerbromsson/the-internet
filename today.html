 <h1>What is the Internet Used for Today?</h1>
 <body>
   <p> The Internet can be used for hundreds maybe thousands of things for example watching videos, looking up questions, 
       the news, games and much more things. Some popular apps are Snapchat and Instagram which could be used to communicate to your 
       friends through the Internet instead of writing a letter. Instagram can be used to share pictures that you've taken of 
       yourself or any other person. Another thing you can do through the Internet is shop online, you don't have to leave your house
        and you can purchase stuff using your card.
