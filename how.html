 <h1>How does the Internet work?</h1>
 <body>
   <p> The Internet simply moves data from one place to another so that we can chat browse and share data moves over 
       the Internet in a manner called packet switching. What packet switching basically does is send your data in
        separate pieces each tagged with your intended destination  a crazy fact! a single Google query uses 1,000 
        computers in 0.2 seconds to retrieve a few million answers.
